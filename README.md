# 💸 Loan Eligibility Predictor

This is a machine learning classification project that predicts whether a bank loan should be approved based on applicant details such as income, credit score, education, etc.

## ✅ Objective

To build a loan approval predictor using supervised learning algorithms — **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest Classifier** — and evaluate it using standard metrics.

## 📁 Dataset Features

- **Age**: Age of applicant  
- **Income**: Monthly income  
- **Education**: Graduate / Not Graduate  
- **Credit Score**: Credit history score  
- **Married**: Yes / No  
- **LoanApproved**: Target variable (Yes / No)

---

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing

- Label encoding for categorical variables (`Education`, `Married`, `LoanApproved`)
- Splitting into training and test sets
- Normalization (if needed)
- Handling missing data (if any)

---

## 🤖 Models Used

- **Logistic Regression**
- **Random Forest Classifier**

Each model was trained and evaluated separately.
